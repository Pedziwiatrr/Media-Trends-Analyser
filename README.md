## About the Project

Media Trends Analyzer is a system designed to monitor, aggregate, and analyze news narratives from various public internet sources.

The application uses Large Language Models (currently Gemini) to generate daily event summaries. It allows users to track how media narratives evolve regarding specific topics (like Politics or Technology) through interactive charts and generated reports.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Aggregation:** The system consumes public RSS feeds (TVN24, Interia, Gazeta Wyborcza) and the BBC API to gather news metadata.
- **AI Analysis:** Uses LangChain agents to categorize content and generate unbiased daily summaries.
- **Custom Reports:** Users can select specific date ranges to generate detailed trend analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts illustrating topic popularity trends over time.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Modular design built with Docker for scalability.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**

- Next.js (React)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

**Backend & AI**

- Python 3.12
- FastAPI
- LangChain
- uv

**Infrastructure & Data**

- PostgreSQL
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Traefik
- GitHub Actions

## System Architecture

The system consists of independent microservices:

1.  **Data Ingestion Service:** Aggregates data from external RSS feeds and APIs.
2.  **Agent Service:** Handles AI logic, summarization, and text processing.
3.  **Database:** Stores metadata and generated summaries.
4.  **API Gateway:** Manages traffic and security.
5.  **Browser Client:** The user interface.

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed.
- **Node.js & npm** (required to run the Client).

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kwasus33/Media-Trends-Analyser
    cd Media-Trends-Analyser
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    The project uses `.env.example` files as templates. You need to copy them to `.env` files and fill in the secrets.

    **A. Root Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory (required for API Gateway security).

    ```env
    VM_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
    ```

    **B. Services Configuration:**
    Run the following commands to create config files from templates:

    ```bash
    cp services/data-scraper-service/.env.example services/data-scraper-service/.env
    cp services/agent-service/.env.example services/agent-service/.env
    ```

    **C. Client Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file inside the `client` directory:

    ```env
    API_URL=http://localhost
    VM_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
    ```

3.  **Run the Backend (Docker):**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4.  **Run the Client (Frontend):**
    Open a new terminal, navigate to the client directory:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    _The application interface will be available at `http://localhost:3000`._
