        "Economy": "China's BYD has surpassed Tesla to become the world's top electric vehicle seller, marking a significant shift in the automotive market. Meanwhile, Canada's micro-condo market is experiencing a historic crash, with smaller units disproportionately losing value, reflecting broader housing trends. This suggests a challenging period for real estate investors and a re-evaluation of housing preferences in major Canadian cities.",
        "Society": "Several societal issues and events are highlighted. In Switzerland, a devastating bar fire in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve killed at least 40 people and injured many more, leading Swiss prosecutors to open a criminal case against the bar managers due to likely cause from sparklers and rapid fire spread. In California, residents navigated floodwaters in the Bay Area, preparing for further coastal inundation.

        "Sport": "In the world of esports, Lee Sang-hyeok, known as \"Faker\" in League of Legends, made history by receiving the Cheongnyong Medal from the South Korean President, marking the first such honor in esports. Robert Lewandowski was the subject of a simulated Barcelona derby game, where a YouTuber predicted him as the hero.",
        "Culture": "The cultural landscape in Poland and beyond is vibrant. Netflix's adaptation of Harlan Coben's \"O krok za daleko\" quickly became a hit in Poland, surpassing \"Stranger Things,\" despite mixed reviews. Gamers are enjoying a plethora of releases, including free titles from Epic Games like Chivalry 2, Monument Valley, and the Trine series. The gaming world also sees old classics like Star Wars Racer Revenge becoming collector's items due to soaring prices. In the music scene, lost recordings of Pavarotti's 1995 concert have been released, delighting fans.

        "Economy": "The global economy faces significant challenges in 2026, including trade tensions and debt, though Goldman Sachs predicts \"solid\" growth, especially for China. The Polish economy is projected to receive a record 180 billion PLN from EU funds, boosting investments, while the IMF warns of negative risks for Polish economic growth. In the financial sector, banks are adjusting; BNP Paribas lowered savings rates, while Bank Millennium offers promotional bonuses. Americans made more housing, installment, and cash loans in late 2025, and 19 US states raised their minimum wage, affecting millions. The real estate market saw prices rise fastest in Tricity, surpassing Krakow, with two other cities also on the rise. The automotive industry experienced a shift as China's BYD overtook Tesla as the world's leading electric car seller. Meanwhile, the courier industry saw its debt decrease, and Polish farmers largely reported stable incomes, with strong support for EU membership. Predictions for the tech market are mixed: graphic card prices, like the RTX 5090, are expected to skyrocket, impacting the gaming hardware sector.",
        "Society": "Polish society faces various challenges and changes in 2026. A tragic bar fire in Switzerland killed 40 and injured 119, including one Pole, prompting authorities to charge two bar managers for negligence; shocking videos showed people filming rather than fleeing. Poland experienced a harsh winter with heavy snowfalls and strong winds, leading to power outages and difficult road conditions, prompting RCB alerts and even the deployment of police Black Hawks for snow clearing. Crime remains a concern, with reports of taxi driver murder, fuel theft, and ongoing investigations into cold cases. Changes in public services include e-Deliveries replacing traditional registered mail, and six new towns gaining city status. Social issues such as high alcohol consumption, the growing popularity of paganism, and the impact of New Year's resolutions are also discussed.",
        "Politics": "The US launched a large-scale military operation in Venezuela, resulting in the capture of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who face drug-terrorism charges in New York.

        "Technology": "The tech world is buzzing with innovation and challenges in 2026. SpaceX is lowering the orbit of thousands of Starlink satellites to enhance space safety and achieved a record 165 orbital missions in 2025. Elon Musk's Neuralink aims for mass production of brain implants to assist paralyzed individuals, marking a potential revolution in medical technology. In military tech, Israel deployed the Iron Beam laser weapon, the world's first operational combat laser, praised for its effectiveness and low cost. Poland is boosting its defense capabilities by producing Krab howitzer barrels domestically and introducing \"Zawilce\" command vehicles, while also planning a quantum communication ground station for secure satellite links. However, cybersecurity threats are escalating, with experts predicting a \"cybertsunami\" of attacks by 2026 and warnings issued about online scams and data leaks, including one affecting the European Space Agency. Concerns also arise over AI's resource consumption, with data centers projected to use vast amounts of water, and its ethical implications, as Elon Musk's Grok chatbot generated illegal content, prompting calls for stricter AI regulation."
