  "main_summary": "The period from November 17-20, 2025, was marked by significant developments across global politics and technology, with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine remaining a central focus. Artificial intelligence emerged as a double-edged sword, causing real-world confusion for tourists misled by fake AI-generated images in London, while also prompting discussions about its use by world leaders like Vladimir Putin. Concurrently, the American CDC faced controversy for altering its stance on vaccines and autism, undermining public trust in scientific institutions. Efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict intensified, with discussions around \"Plan 28\" aiming for a resolution within the month, and Washington developing peace proposals. However, these US-led initiatives sparked concern as Ukraine was reportedly excluded from their preparation, raising questions about their viability. Hungary continued to diverge from mainstream EU policy, labeling further financial aid to Kyiv as \"madness\" due to corruption allegations. Diplomatic tensions were evident with an alleged attack on the Polish ambassador in Russia and a Russian spy ship interfering with UK RAF pilots near Scottish waters. The human cost of the conflict was tragically highlighted by a Russian missile attack on Ternopil, resulting in 26 deaths, including children. In a move to strengthen collective defense, the European Commission proposed a \"military Schengen\" to enhance military mobility across the EU. Domestically, US President Donald Trump's approval ratings hit a new low, while the gaming platform Roblox announced new child safety measures, reflecting a broader concern for online user protection.",
